# In-Game Event Arbitrage Implementation

## Task 9: Event-Driven Trading Strategy

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fully Implemented and Tested

### Overview

The In-Game Event Arbitrage Strategy is a sophisticated event-driven trading system that exploits predictable price patterns around gaming ecosystem events. This implementation focuses on tournament tokens, game development cycles, and community events within the Gala Games ecosystem.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Game Calendar System (`src/data/game-calendar.ts`)

**Comprehensive Event Management System**:
- **27 Event Types**: Tournament events, game updates, community events, economic events
- **Event Impact Prediction**: Pre-event runs, peak impact, post-event dumps
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor analysis with historical accuracy tracking
- **Source Reliability**: Weighted scoring from official, community, and on-chain sources

**Key Features**:
```typescript
// Event categories supported
- Tournament Events: Esports tournaments, community competitions, championships
- Development Events: Major updates, season launches, DLC releases, beta launches
- Community Events: Challenges, governance votes, staking events, NFT launches
- Economic Events: Node license sales, token burns, partnerships, exchange listings
- Technical Events: Maintenance windows, server upgrades, network migrations
```

**Risk-Aware Event Scoring**:
- Historical accuracy tracking (learning from actual vs predicted impact)
- Source reliability weighting (official sources get higher weight)
- Data freshness penalties (stale data reduces confidence)
- Multi-source validation bonuses

#### 2. Event Arbitrage Strategy (`src/trading/strategies/event-arbitrage.ts`)

**Event-Driven Position Management**:
- **Pre-Event Positioning**: 48-72 hours before major events
- **During-Event Trading**: Capitalize on peak activity
- **Post-Event Profit-Taking**: Exit before predicted dumps
- **Multi-Phase Trading**: Full cycle or targeted phase strategies

**Advanced Opportunity Scoring**:
```typescript
// Opportunity scoring algorithm
Base Score: 50
+ Event Confidence (0-30 points): Confidence above 50% scaled to 30 points
+ Impact Level (0-25 points): LOW=5, MEDIUM=15, HIGH=25, EXTREME=35
+ Event Type Weight (0-20 points): Galaverse=20, Tournaments=14-16, Maintenance=16
+ Timing Bonus (0-15 points): 24-72 hours = optimal, others reduced
+ Market Conditions (0-10 points): Good liquidity and suitable volatility
+ Historical Accuracy (0-5 points): Bonus for >70% accuracy
```

**Risk Management Framework**:
- **Position Limits**: 4% max per event, 15% total exposure
- **Confidence Thresholds**: 60% minimum confidence for execution
- **Hold Time Limits**: 7-day maximum position duration
- **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Market conditions, event verification, timing factors
- **Circuit Breakers**: Strategy shutdown if 3-month underperformance

#### 3. Strategy Integration (`src/trading/strategies/strategy-orchestrator.ts`)

**Orchestrator Integration**:
- **Priority 9**: High priority for predictable event patterns
- **15% Capital Allocation**: Balanced exposure for event opportunities
- **4-Hour Cooldown**: Events need time to develop between executions
- **Multi-Market Compatibility**: Works in bull, bear, sideways, and volatile markets

### Gaming Event Categories Implemented

  postEventDump: -0.04,   // -4% after tournament
  volumeIncrease: 2.0     // 200% volume increase
}
```

#### Game Development Events
```typescript
// Major Updates: Significant game patches and new features
expectedImpact: {
  preEventRun: 0.08,      // 8% run-up 3 days before
  eventPeak: 0.07,        // 7% during announcement
  postEventDump: -0.05,   // -5% profit taking
  volumeIncrease: 2.2     // 220% volume surge
}

// Season Launches: New game seasons with meta changes
expectedImpact: {
  preEventRun: 0.18,      // 18% run-up 7 days before
  eventPeak: 0.12,        // 12% during event
  postEventDump: -0.15,   // -15% sell the news
  volumeIncrease: 3.5     // 350% volume surge
}
```

#### Community Events
```typescript
// Staking Events: Time-limited staking bonuses
expectedImpact: {
  preEventRun: 0.02,      // 2% run-up 2 days before
  eventPeak: 0.01,        // 1% during event
  postEventDump: -0.03,   // -3% dump from selling rewards
  volumeIncrease: 1.5     // 150% volume increase
}
```

#### Economic Events
```typescript
// Galaverse Events: Quarterly community gatherings
expectedImpact: {
  preEventRun: 0.18,      // 18% run-up 7 days before
  eventPeak: 0.12,        // 12% during event
  postEventDump: -0.15,   // -15% sell the news
  volumeIncrease: 3.5     // 350% volume surge
}
```

### Game-Specific Token Events

#### Gala Ecosystem Events
- **Node License Sales**: Major GALA burning events
- **Game Launches**: New games requiring GALA for assets
- **Partnership Announcements**: Ecosystem expansion news

### Technical Implementation

#### Event Detection and Scheduling
```typescript
// Automated event scheduling with EventScheduler
- Pre-event positioning: 48-72 hours before event
- During-event monitoring: Real-time position management
- Post-event exits: Scheduled profit-taking and risk management
- Pattern learning: Historical accuracy tracking and confidence updates
```

#### Position Management
```typescript
// Multi-phase position management
Phase 1: Pre-Event (48-72h before)
- Entry based on confidence and impact scoring
- Risk-adjusted position sizing
- Stop-loss and take-profit levels set

Phase 2: During Event
- Monitor for early exit opportunities
- Adjust positions based on actual vs expected impact
- Volume and volatility confirmations

Phase 3: Post-Event
- Scheduled exits during expected dump periods
- Profit-taking on successful predictions
- Loss limitation on failed predictions
```

### Risk Management Framework

#### Position Limits
- **4% Maximum Per Event**: Prevents over-concentration in single events
- **15% Total Exposure**: Maximum combined exposure to all event positions
- **Event Confidence Minimum**: 60% threshold for trade execution
- **7-Day Hold Limit**: Maximum position duration regardless of event timing

#### Risk Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
Risk Score Calculation:
Base Risk: 30%
+ Low Confidence Penalty: (1 - confidence) * 30%
+ Market Volatility Risk: Extreme=20%, High=10%
+ Liquidity Risk: Poor=20%, Fair=10%
+ Unverified Event Penalty: 10%
+ Timing Risk: <6h or >336h = 10%
```

#### Circuit Breakers
- **3-Month Performance Window**: Track strategy success over rolling quarters
- **Automatic Shutdown**: If strategy consistently underperforms benchmarks
- **Manual Override**: Administrative controls for emergency situations
