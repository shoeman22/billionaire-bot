# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **billionaire-bot** repository, currently containing the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server setup configuration. The repository is in early stages with only the Claude MCP infrastructure setup.

## MCP Server Configuration

This repository uses a comprehensive set of MCP servers for enhanced Claude Code functionality. The setup is managed through `setup-claude-mcp.sh`.

### Available MCP Servers
- **playwright** - Browser automation and testing
- **typescript-language-server** - TypeScript language support and intellisense
- **filesystem** - File system operations
- **git** - Git repository management
- **sequential-thinking** - Advanced reasoning workflows
- **zen** - Enhanced AI collaboration tools
- **memory** - Persistent knowledge graph
- **perplexity** - Web search and research
- **browser-tools** - Advanced browser debugging and analysis
- **fetch** - Direct web content retrieval
- **mcp-compass** - Navigation and exploration tools
- **framelink-figma-mcp** - Figma design integration
- **puppeteer** - Browser automation with screenshots
- **magic-ui** - UI component generation
- **context7** - Context management

### Setup Commands

**Initial MCP Setup:**
```bash
./setup-claude-mcp.sh
```

**Note:** After running the setup script, restart Claude Code to load all servers.

## Development Environment

### Screenshots Directory
- Puppeteer screenshots are saved to `.screenshots/` directory in the project root
- This directory is automatically created when needed

### Workspace Configuration
- TypeScript language server is configured to use the current project directory as workspace
- Git operations are available through the dedicated MCP server

## Project Architecture

This repository appears to be designed as a foundation for a "billionaire-bot" application with robust tooling support through MCP servers. The current setup provides:

1. **Development Tools** - TypeScript support, git integration, file operations
2. **Browser Automation** - Playwright and Puppeteer for testing and interaction
3. **AI Enhancement** - Sequential thinking, memory, and research capabilities
4. **Design Integration** - Figma connectivity for design-to-code workflows
5. **UI Generation** - Magic UI for component creation


The repository is currently empty of application code, suggesting it is ready for initial development of the billionaire-bot application.
## AI Team Configuration (autogenerated by team-configurator, 2025-01-18)

**Important: YOU MUST USE subagents when available for the task.**

### Detected Stack
- **Project Type**: Bot/Automation Application (early stage)
- **Infrastructure**: Comprehensive MCP server setup
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright + Puppeteer configured
- **Language Support**: TypeScript language server ready
- **Tooling**: Advanced debugging, UI generation, design integration
- **Status**: Fresh repository ready for initial development

### AI Team Assignments

| Task | Agent | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Core Quality Assurance** |
| Code review and security audit | `code-reviewer` | MANDATORY before any commits |
| Performance optimization | `performance-optimizer` | Use for bot efficiency and scaling |
| **Architecture & Planning** |
| Complex feature planning | `tech-lead-orchestrator` | Multi-step tasks and architectural decisions |
| Codebase exploration | `code-archaeologist` | When analyzing unfamiliar code or legacy systems |
| **API Development** |
| API design and contracts | `api-architect` | RESTful APIs for bot interactions |
| Server-side implementation | `backend-developer` | Universal backend development |
| **Frontend Development** |
| UI implementation | `frontend-developer` | Bot dashboard, admin panels, web interfaces |
| React components (if chosen) | `react-component-architect` | If React is selected for frontend |
| Next.js applications (if chosen) | `react-nextjs-expert` | If Next.js is selected for web interface |
| **Bot-Specific Development** |
| Browser automation | Use MCP tools directly | Playwright/Puppeteer for web scraping |
| AI integration | Use MCP tools directly | Memory, perplexity, sequential-thinking |
| Web research | Use MCP tools directly | Fetch, perplexity for data gathering |

### Development Workflow Recommendations

**For Bot Development:**
1. Start with `@tech-lead-orchestrator` for feature planning
2. Use `@api-architect` for external API integrations
3. Use `@backend-developer` for core bot logic
4. Use `@frontend-developer` for any web interfaces
5. Always use `@code-reviewer` before commits
6. Use `@performance-optimizer` for scaling and efficiency

**For Browser Automation:**
- Leverage Playwright MCP for testing and UI automation
- Use Puppeteer MCP for screenshots and parallel automation
- Use Memory MCP to track successful automation patterns
- Use Fetch MCP for direct web content retrieval

### Sample Usage Examples

**Feature Planning:**
```
@tech-lead-orchestrator Plan a web scraping module for billionaire news tracking
```

**API Development:**
```
@api-architect Design REST API for bot configuration and status reporting
```

**Backend Implementation:**
```
@backend-developer Build the core news aggregation engine with TypeScript
```

**Code Quality:**
```
@code-reviewer Review the web scraping implementation for security and best practices
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```
@performance-optimizer Optimize the bot for handling 1000+ concurrent web requests
```
