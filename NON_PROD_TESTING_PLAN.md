# 🧪 NON-PRODUCTION TESTING PLAN
## Maximum Testing Coverage Before Production Launch

---

## 🎯 **Overview**

This plan maximizes testing coverage using our **DEV environment wallet** before risking real funds in production. We can test **~95% of the trading bot functionality** safely.

### Current DEV Environment
- **Wallet**: `eth|9401b171307bE656f00F9e18DF756643FD3a91dE`
- **API Endpoints**: `dex-backend-dev1.defi.gala.com` (DEV environment)
- **Risk Level**: **ZERO** - No real money, test tokens only
- **Testing Scope**: Complete infrastructure, logic, and integration testing

---

## ✅ **What We CAN Test (100% Safe)**

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure Testing**
- [x] API connectivity and authentication
- [x] Wallet signing and payload generation
- [x] Database operations (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- [x] All risk management systems
- [x] Emergency controls and circuit breakers
- [x] Alert system and notifications
- [x] Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- [x] Error handling and recovery
- [x] Component initialization and lifecycle

### 🧠 **Trading Logic Testing**
- [x] Arbitrage opportunity detection algorithms
- [x] Price calculation and slippage estimation
- [x] Position sizing logic
- [x] Risk/reward calculations
- [x] Transaction payload generation
- [x] Strategy decision-making
- [x] Portfolio management logic

### 🌐 **API Integration Testing**
- [x] Quote generation (`/v1/trade/quote`)
- [x] Price fetching (`/v1/trade/price`)
- [x] Pool discovery (`/v1/trade/pools`)
- [x] Swap payload creation (`/v1/trade/swap`)
- [x] Transaction status checking

2. **Create Production Migration Plan**
   - Update API URLs to production endpoints
   - Switch to production wallet
   - Set conservative trading limits
   - Enable all monitoring systems

3. **Production Testing Strategy**
   - Start with $1 micro-trades
